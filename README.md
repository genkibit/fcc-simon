Visit this **[wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game))** for more information. This is one of a series of projects for the 
front-end program of **[freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/)**. The project rubric is as follows:

+ Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to **[this example](http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/obYBjE)**.
+ Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
+ Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
+ User Story: I am presented with a random series of button presses.
+ User Story: Each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.
+ User Story: I hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when I personally press a button.
+ User Story: If I press the wrong button, I am notified that I have done so, and that series of button presses starts again to remind me of the pattern so I can try again.
+ User Story: I can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses.
+ User Story: If I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.
+ User Story: I can play in strict mode where if I get a button press wrong, it notifies me that I have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.
+ User Story: I can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. I am notified of my victory, then the game starts over.
